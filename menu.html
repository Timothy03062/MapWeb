<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
  <a align="center">
   <h3>Aim</h3>
  <p>The aim of the data analysis is to observe a relationship between the amount of motor vehicles a household may have to a household's weekly median income.</p>
  
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>It has been observed at there has been a significant increase in coastal areas of NSW in households with two motor vehicles,  and the inner west of Sydney. For weekly income, there also seems to be strong median income increases within Sydney, eastward regions and small pockets interstate in 2016 compared to 2011. Although there are varying circumstances, the increase in Sydney seems to match along prominent public transport lines and the city's "Three City" concept.</p>
<br>
<h5>Motor Vehicles</h5>
<p>The growth of households possessing with two motor vehicles has been small in NSW overall between 2011 and 2016 respectively, primarily in regional NSW. On average, there has been a decrease in 10-20 households with two vehicles in each statistical zone, yet positive increase in neighbouring zones by around 10-20, balancing out the decrease. The general trend has shown a strong increases in middle and eastern(coastal) NSW, with significant increases of in areas such as metropolitan Sydney, Newcastle, Wagga Wagga. </p>

<p>Within metropolitan Sydney between 2011 and 2016, there has been increases in the North Shores and the inner west. Significant increases have been found in suburbs such as Parramatta, Richmond, and Penrith with increases by 30 households or more. This is could be because of government initiative to develop the areas like Parramatta, increases in population through both domestic migration and international immigration or potentially due to inefficient public transport hence requiring households to have more vehicles to travel.</p>

<h5>Median Income per Household Weekly</h5>
<p>Between 2011 and 2016, there has been strong growth within NSW overall. In line with the general growth trend as seen in Motor Vehicles, growth is more directed and prominent towards the east. Particular growth is found in and around large cities in NSW like Sydney, Armidale, Wagga Wagga, and so on. Growth however isn't limited to the east, a significant portion of western zones and regional areas have also increased its median income bracket in 2016 compared to 2011.This could be due to NSW economic growth has it has experienced an average of 7-8% growth per annum between 2012-2013 and Australia itself has experienced 1%-1.5% growth in average. An increased economy translates into increased employment rates and people receiving an income. Also rises in the minimal income is $17.79 per hour would also increase the household income weekly. There has been an increase an estimated average of $500 and more to zones which experienced a increase. </p>

<p> Within Sydney, there also appears to be strong growth. The north and west seem to have experienced more growth compared to the southern areas. The north region on average also are observed to have to experienced grotht into brackets between on average $1942 to %4750 on weekly household income. A particular point of interest is the Parramatta region which has had exponential growth between 2011 and 2012. This could be due to recent government initiative such as "The Three City" development, increases in economic activity and infrastructure and more "white" collar jobs and professionals within these regions.</p>

<h3>Comparison</h3>
<p> The 'latte line' is an imaginary boundary that splits Sydney down class and economic lines, running from the airport north-west through Parramatta. Both data sets relate to the "latte line" as the North-Western region of Sydney appears to be experiencing more development and growth compared to other regions. The divide seems to be more clear between 2011 and 2016 in income growth in concentrated regions like Parramatta and Epping  compared to thier sourthern counterparts. In terms of motor vehicles, although the divide is slight and mostly evenly spread out, the north still has more households with two vehicles when comparing data from 2011 and 2016. 
<br>
<br>
This is significant to the relationship between income and vehicles, as it proves that households with more income are more likely to purchase more motor vehicles. What it also signifies is the labour mobility of people.Although typically the north is more "prosperous" than the south, individuals and families could move to less costly areas of Sydney to save costs and the rise in income potentially allows households to purchase more vehicles and travel further distances to work. </p>

<p>The NSW government has proposed a "Three City" development plan, stretching from Sydney CBD, Parramatta and Badgerys Creek. It can be seen within metropolitan Sydney from visualisation of income and vehicles, that between 2011, 2016 and recent statistics that most growth and developement is happening around these indicated city concentrations and aligns with the proposal. This is most likely because of both government and business future investment and development projections.
